# String Manipulation and Number Operations

This program implements three basic algorithms that involve string manipulation and number operations:

1. **Reverse a String**
2. **Find the Second-Largest Number in an Array**
3. **Check if a Given String is a Palindrome**

Each function takes user input via the command line interface (CLI) and returns the result after performing the respective algorithm.


## Features

- **Reverse a String**: Reverses a string inputted by the user.
- **Find the Second-Largest Number**: Finds the second-largest number from a comma-separated list of numbers entered by the user.
- **Palindrome Check**: Checks if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.


## Requirements

- **Node.js**: This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.
- **CLI-based input**: The program uses the `readline` module in Node.js to take user input via the CLI.


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source files to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Open your terminal and run the following command to execute the program:
   ```bash
